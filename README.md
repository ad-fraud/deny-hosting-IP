# deny-hosting-IP
#### A system for anyone to easily identify / block over 130,000,000 cloud and hosting company IP addresses.

In 2014 Darkreading.com reported use of freely available cloud/hosting resources for malice in an article title "CloudBot: A Free, Malwareless Alternative To Traditional Botnets"[1] covering research by BishopFox researchers[2] Rob Ragan and Oscar Salazar. I highly recommend reading the article, and watching the video.  

Fast forward 2 years and "cloudbots" play a crucial role in fuelling sourced traffic market at the heart of the +$10 billion per year ad fraud wave. Depending on the publisher or ad platform, cloudbots usually represent upwards from 1% of total traffic. It is therefore alone a problem in the 9-figure (dollar) range. The good news is that allowing cloudbots to thrive in the online advertising eco-system is easy to stop, by systematically blocking traffic from hosting company IP ranges at both publisher and ad platform level. Here is an easy and low-cost way of starting to do it.
